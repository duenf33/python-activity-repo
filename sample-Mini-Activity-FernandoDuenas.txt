* Create a Psuedocode Algorithm to perform the following function:
    (For convertin specifically numbers 0-255)
    a. Convert Decimal Numbers (like 255) to its equivalent Binary Number format (11111111)

1. Get the number in decimal that you want to convert to binary.
2. Evaluate the Square Root of the Number Passed in.
    2a. Round that value up to the nearest whole number
3. Store that value somewhere. ->
4. Divide that stored value by 2.
5. Store that value somewhere. -> (representing the bits)
6 you need to create a "collection" that stores as many items as there are bits.
7. Iterate through the collection
8. At each item in the collection (there should be as many as there bits) we are going to perform a check
9. 

I want you guys to psuedocode your own steps to convert a Decimal Number (like 255) into Binary format (11111111) 

- array: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
- take decimal value from input
- find the sum of the array to be equal to the decimal input
- using the index of each value from the array find the numbers used to sum up to the input value.
