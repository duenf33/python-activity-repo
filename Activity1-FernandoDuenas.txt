I have created this Pseudocode starting from a point of view more descriptive to a computer, to a simple one describing it to a person already having experience with it.

Create a Pseudocode Text File Describing the Process of:

1. Brushing Your Teeth
    step 0 - move hand to 5 inches from chest.
    step 1 - Calculate the distance of tooth paste from left hand initial state, where your standing. 
    step 2 - reach out with left hand and grab tooth paste using (step 1) calculations, having the cap of the toothpaste tube by the left thumb and index finger.
    step 3 - retract arm towards the initial state.

    step 4 - calculate distance from right hand to left hand.
    step 5 - using the right hand index finger and the thumb reach out to the toothpaste's cap.
    step 6 - flip cap over, leaving an aperture of roughly 1/4 inch. 

    step 12 - calculate distance of toothbrush from right hand initial state.
    step 13 - reach out with right hand and grab tooth brush by the handle using (step 4) calculations.
    step 14 - pull toothbrush out of container.
    step 15 - retract right hand to the initial state.

    step 16 - turn toothbrush with the brush facing up.
    step 17 - calculate distance from toothpaste tube to toothbrush
    step 18 - place the open aperture side of toothpaste tube close to the toothbrush brush.
    step 19 - starting with slow and gentle pressure squeezing toothpaste tube with the left hand.
    step 20 - calculate a small amount of 1/4 inch radius squeezed out of toothpaste tube onto the toothbrush brush.

    step 21 - calculate distance of countertop from left hand with toothpaste.
    step 22 - with (step 21) calculations reach out to countertop.
    step 23 - place left hand with toothpaste tube on the countertop.
    step 24 - open left hand releasing toothpaste onto countertop. 

    step 25 - calculate distance of faucet cold water knob from left hand.
    step 26 - reach out to faucet cold water knob with left hand.
    step 27 - once left hand placed on faucet cold water knob, hold knob with left hand.
    step 28 - rotate knob to the right with left hand until there is a <small> amount of water pouring out of faucet.
    
    step 29 - calculate distance of water streaming out of faucet from right hand with toothbrush.
    step 30 - move right hand with toothbrush in the stream of water pouring out of faucet.
    step 31 - leave toothbrush in water for only 5 seconds.
    step 32 - retract right hand to initial state.
    
    step 33 - calculate distante to mouth from right hand initial state.
    step 34 - calculate upper front teeth to jaw distance
    step 35 - calculate bottom front teeth to jaw distance
    step 36 - calculate length of brush of toothbrush
    step 37 - calculate thickness of plastic holding brush.
    step 38 - add (step 36 and step 37)
    step 39 - result of (step 38) + 1/4 inch will be the distance of bottom front tooth from top front tooth.
    step 40 - measure jaw angle opening with (step 39)
    step 41 - set (step 40) as angle of mouth opening for brushing teeth.

    step 41 - using (step 33) move right hand with toothbrush to mouth.
    step 42 - using (step step 39) calculations keep center toothbrush with same even clearance from bottom and top tooth.
-   step 43 - reach to back of mouth at the end of the ${right} row side alignment of ${bottom} teeth.

    step 44 - place brush side of toothbrush <gently> against last tooth of the row
    step 45 - using (step 35) move toothbrush back and forth at a speed of 1 revolution per second for only 5 seconds

    step 46 - move toothbrush at 90 degrees to right side of teeth 

    step 47 - repeat (step 44 and step 45)

    step 48 - move toothbrush at 180 degrees to left side of teeth

    step 49 - repeat (step 47)

    step 50 - move toothbrush 90 degrees to the right towards the top teeth.

    step 51 - repeat (step 43 - ${right} ${top}) thru (step 49)

    step 52 - stop toothbrush revolutions.
    step 53 - calculate distance of right side of mouth teeth to left side.
    step 54 - move toothbrush with slow speed to the left side of mouth avoiding hitting the tongue.
    step 55 - repeat (step 43 - ${left} ${bottom}) to (step 52)

    step 56 - rotate toothbrush 180 degrees aligning with the left side of teeth.
    step 58 - while keeping toothbrush contact with teeth move toothbrush
    step 59 - align front upper tooth with front bottom tooth
    step 60 - close mouth <slightly> making a <slow> <gentle> contact of the upper and bottom front teeth.


    ( I will stop at this step because if I dont will keep going another 60 steps.)
