#Avtivity 3: Declare Variables:

#2- On this File I would like you to write the appropriate python code to satisfy these requirements:
#a- Assign the Value of 5 to a Variable called num.
num = 5

#b- Assign the Value of "YourName" in a Variable called name.
name = "FernandDuenas"

#c- Assign the Value of True in a Variable called isPython.
isPython = True

#d- Write 2 sentences about something you've learned about Python so far in this course.
    #i. Wrap that sentence inside of two double quotes
        #1. so that means put double quote at the beginning and end of that sentence
    #ii. Assign that sentence to a Variable called sentence.

sentence = "variables can be declared by any name or even alphabets such as regular letters, however, there needs to be a good naming convention to be able to have your code readable. There are Standard Data Types such as Numbers, String, Booleans and Collection Data Types such as List, Tuple, Dictionary."

#Bonus:
#Create a variable give it any name you'd like following the practices of names and asign it any number.
numberOne = 3

#Assign the value of the sum of your variable and num to a variable called total.
total = num + numberOne
print(total)
