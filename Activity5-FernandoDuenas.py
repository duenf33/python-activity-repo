Activity 5: Tuples and Lists

    1. Create a file on VS Code and name it Activity5-YourName along with the appropriate python extension.
    2. On this file I would like you do write the appropriate python code to satisfy these requirements:
'''
# a. Write a Python program to create a tuple with different data types.
myTuple0 = ('Fernando', True, 3)
print(type(myTuple0))

# b. Write a Python program to create a tuple with multiple values and print the last item.
myTuple1 = ('computer', 'mouse', 'keyboard', 'monitor', 'cell phone')
print(myTuple1[-1])

# c. Write a Python pogram to get 4th element from the front and 4th element from last of a tuple.
myTuple2 = ('book', 'pen', 'pencil', 'eraser', 'textbook', 'stapler', 'bottle', 'table', 'chair')
print(myTuple2[3])
print(myTuple2[-4])

# d. Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple.
print(len(myTuple2))
